grablox 
=======  
A python module grablox, containing a solver and emulator for the game graBLOX by MobilityWare.  

I wrote these python classes in an attempt to answer the following sort of question: "Here is a new level that you've never seen before. It is solvable in 10 moves. Is it solvable in 9 moves though?"

This code is very much under development, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
